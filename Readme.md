# Yasbf #

Yasbf is a basic blogging engine I wrote.

Its input is simply a directory of html text files, and a basic transformation script automatically renders the blog HTML from them as needed.

It’s unsuitable and unnecessary for nearly everyone, but I somehow like it.

You will find a short Documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Poapfel/Yasbf/wiki).
