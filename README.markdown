# Yasbf #

Yasbf is a basic blogging framework I wrote.

Its input is a directory of html files and a transformation script automatically renders the blog HTML from them.

It's probably unnecessary for everyone, but I somehow like it.

You will find a short Documentation about Yasbf in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Poapfel/Yasbf/wiki).
